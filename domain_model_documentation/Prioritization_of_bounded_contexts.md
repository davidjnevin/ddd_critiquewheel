Following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology aligns well with the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). TDD ensures that the software is built with a strong foundation of tests, which can greatly improve the quality and maintainability of the system.

Prioritizing the core functionalities:

1. **Work Management**: This is the foundation of the entire system. Members need to be able to submit their fictional works before any critiques or ratings can happen. Implementing this first ensures that there's content in the system to work with.

2. **Critique Management**: Once works are submitted, the next logical step is to allow members to critique them. This also introduces the credit system, where members earn credits for critiquing and spend them to submit their own works.

3. **Rating Management**: After critiques are in place, allowing members to rate the critiques they receive adds another layer of feedback and starts building the reputation system.

**Member Management** can be added later. While it's essential for a complete system, the initial focus on works, critiques, and ratings allows you to build out the core functionalities and interactions first. Once those are robust and well-tested, integrating member management (with features like profiles, reputation tracking, and possibly even monetization) becomes a more straightforward task.

Starting with Work Management, Critique Management, and Rating Management, and following a TDD approach for each, will ensure that the core business logic is solid and well-tested before moving on to other aspects of the system.
