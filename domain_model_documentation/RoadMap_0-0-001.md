## Road Map

1. **Detailed Entity Specifications**: While we've identified entities and their attributes, we should provide more detailed specifications for each, including data types, constraints, and potential default values.

2. **User Stories or Use Cases**: Create user stories or use cases that describe how users will interact with the system. This will give the technical team a clear understanding of the expected functionalities and user flows.

3. **System Architecture and Design**: Decide on the system's architecture. Will it be a monolithic application, microservices-based, or some other architecture? This will also involve decisions about the tech stack, databases, and potential third-party integrations.

4. **API Specifications**: If the system will have multiple components or if there's a plan for mobile or web frontends, you'll need API specifications. Tools like Swagger or Postman can be used to document these.

5. **Security Protocols**: Given that the system will handle user data and potentially payments (for paid critiques), it's crucial to outline security protocols, data encryption methods, and compliance requirements.

6. **Deployment Strategy**: Decide on where and how the software will be deployed. This includes choosing between cloud providers, considering scalability, and setting up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

7. **Testing Strategy**: Outline how the software will be tested. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Define criteria that the software must meet to be considered production-ready.

8. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop with the technical team. Regular check-ins and reviews will ensure that the development aligns with the domain model and business requirements.

9. **Documentation**: Ensure that all the above points, along with the domain model documentation we've created, are compiled into a comprehensive document. This will serve as the primary reference for the technical team.

10. **Kick-off Meeting**: Once all documentation is ready, organize a kick-off meeting with the technical team. This is an opportunity to walk them through the domain model, answer questions, and ensure everyone is aligned.

The goal is to provide the technical team with as much clarity as possible. The more detailed and clear the documentation, the smoother the development process will be.
