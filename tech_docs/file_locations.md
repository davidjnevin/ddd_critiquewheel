## File Locations

1. **Repository Interface**:
    - Location: `critique_wheel/domain/models/`
    - Rationale: The repository interface is a domain concept, and it should be defined close to the domain models. You can define the interface for the `Work` repository in the `work.py` file or in a separate interface file within the `models` directory.

2. **Repository Implementation**:
    - Location: `critique_wheel/adapters/`
    - Rationale: The actual implementation of the repository is an adapter that connects the domain to the data source (e.g., a database). Therefore, it should be placed in the `adapters` directory. You can create a file named `work_repository.py` for the `Work` repository implementation.

3. **ORM Models (if using an ORM like SQLAlchemy)**:
    - Location: `critique_wheel/adapters/orm.py`
    - Rationale: ORM models act as a bridge between the domain models and the database. They should be defined in the `orm.py` file within the `adapters` directory.

4. **Database Migrations (if applicable)**:
    - Location: A new directory, `critique_wheel/migrations/`
    - Rationale: If you're using a tool like Alembic for database migrations, it's common to have a separate `migrations` directory at the same level as `domain`, `adapters`, etc.

5. **Repository Tests**:
    - Location: `tests/unit/`
    - Rationale: Tests for the repository should be placed in the `unit` tests directory, as they will test individual units of functionality. You can create a file named `test_work_repository.py` for the repository tests.

6. **Configuration and Connection Strings**:
    - Location: `critique_wheel/config.py`
    - Rationale: Database connection strings and other configuration details should be stored in the `config.py` file or in environment variables for security reasons.

7. **Service Layer**:
    - Location: `critique_wheel/domain/services/`
    - Rationale: If you have services that orchestrate complex operations involving multiple domain models, they should be placed in the `services` directory. These services will often use the repository to interact with the data source.

In summary, the repository pattern will involve changes and additions to multiple directories, but the primary implementation will reside in the `adapters` directory, as it acts as a bridge between the domain and the data source.
