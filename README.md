# Critique Wheel - A Short Story Critique Exchange

This is the Critique Wheel, a web application for the free exchange of critiques for writers of short fiction.
Members exchange critiques on their work helping them imporve their writing craft and prepare for publishing.

Exchanging critiques and is the best way to improve your writing craft, but the turnaround on getting critiques is very slow. Most writing groups start out with monthly meetings and exchanging print-outs or maybe emailed documents. In my writng group, we evolved into a shared Google Drive folder, with a feedback form, a neat pdf creation plugin and a lively WhatsApp group. But all these forms had their drawbacks. The biggest being the delay on getting a critique on your work.

Iâ€™ve captured the three crucial characteristics of good critiques, objectivity, generosity and actionable feedback, and integrated them into an accessible online tool.
